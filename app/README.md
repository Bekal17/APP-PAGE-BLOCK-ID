# App (Trust Ledger)

This app includes the **AI Trust Scoring Engine** in `ai-engine/`. To run the trust API from this folder: `npm run dev:api` (or see `ai-engine/README.md`).

**Trust Analytics (UI)** – On the Trust Analytics page, paste a Solana wallet and click "Get trust score" to fetch a live score from the backend. Set `VITE_TRUST_API_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:8000`) if the API runs on a different origin.
